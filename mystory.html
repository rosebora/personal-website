          <h2>The Basics</h2>
          <p>
            Although I was born in Chicago, my childhood was filled with constant moving. I spent my early years between Chicago and Milwaukee before relocating to Cleveland for middle school. Born to two lovely Turkish parents, I was blessed (or cursed!) with a sister when I was around four. Despite our moments of sibling rivalry, we are now inseparable. In hindsight, all the moving was the best thing to happen to me. However, if you had asked 12-year-old me, I would have said my life was over! My true passions for life, a career, and a future blossomed in Ohio.

          <h2>Finding Clarity</h2>
          <p>
            In the middle of my sophomore year, a routine Visionworks appointment revealed a macular hole, starting a long journey that resulted in 9 retinal surgeries, 47 doctor visits, and 3 months lying face down in a massage chair. Following a referral to Retina Associates, I received laser treatment and realized those were my last moments with full vision in my left eye. <br>
            <br> 
      
            At 14, I began my first of eight surgeries, each bringing new complications. This cycle stole every football game, school dance, and orchestra concert, replacing them with doctor visits and health restrictions. Throughout recovery, Google MD became my resource, and my ophthalmology knowledge grew as I explored new eye conditions. <br>
            <br>
      
            My previous disinterest at the doctor's office transformed into peeking over my surgeonâ€™s shoulder, asking questions, and engaging in conversations about various eye conditions. Surprisingly, three months after my last surgery, I became a 17-year-old Ophthalmic Technician at Retina Associates. <br>
            <br>

            <img src="well.png" alt="our-story" />
            <p>
                <br>
              During my downtime, I found solace in coding. I self-taught Python and began dabbling in Java, finding joy in solving problems through code. Conversations with Dr. Wiley about African children's susceptibility to cataracts led me to reflect on my own medical privilege. I raised $4,500 to provide 2,000 Nigerians with clean water and created a Python script to determine the longest distance between cities and wells, ultimately placing a well in Maiduguri, Nigeria. <br>
              <br>

          <p>
            <br>
            By combining my passion for ophthalmology and coding, these experiences have shaped my goal to leverage off technology in healthcare. Although my vision isn't 20/20, my passion for merging technology and medicine is clear. <br>
