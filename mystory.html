          <h2>The Basics</h2>
          <p>
            Although I was born in Chicago, my childhood was filled with constant moving. I spent my early years between Chicago and Milwaukee before relocating to Cleveland for middle school. Born to two lovely Turkish parents, I was blessed (or cursed!) with a sister when I was around four. Despite our moments of sibling rivalry, we are now inseparable. In hindsight, all the moving was the best thing to happen to me. However, if you had asked 12-year-old me, I would have said my life was over! My true passions for life, a career, and a future blossomed in Ohio.

          <h2>My Vision</h2>
          <p>
            My journey into the world of healthcare began unexpectedly with a routine Visionworks appointment that revealed a macular hole. This discovery led to a series of nine retinal surgeries and numerous doctor visits. These experiences, though challenging, sparked my interest in the medical field. What initially began as a necessity evolved into a passion as I became increasingly fascinated by the complexities of ophthalmology and the human eye.
            <br>
            <br> 
            During my recovery, I found solace and excitement in coding. Teaching myself Python and exploring Java, I discovered a new passion for technology. This intersection of healthcare and technology quickly became my focus. I realized that combining these fields could lead to innovative solutions that significantly improve patient outcomes.
            <br>
            <br>
            Driven by these experiences, I decided to double major in Computer Science and Biochemistry when I entered college. As I delved deeper into each field, I realized that their intersection held revolutionary potential. In the summer of 2024, I explored this potential at the Discovery Accelerator, a partnership between IBM and Cleveland Clinic. There, I participated in pediatric cardiology research using IBM’s powerful neural network resources. Witnessing firsthand how IBM's technology impacted the field of research validated my passion and strengthened my resolve to push the boundaries at this intersection.
            <br>
            <br>
            My ultimate goal is to leverage technology to advance healthcare and I am dedicated to making a meaningful impact in the lives of others through this integration. Whether it's through developing software to improve medical diagnostics or creating algorithms to enhance patient care, I am committed to exploring and implementing innovative solutions that bridge the gap between these two fields. Although my vision isn't 20/20, my commitment to merging technology and medicine is crystal clear.
