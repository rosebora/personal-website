          <h3>EKG Digitization</h3>
          <p class="info-content">
            <br>
            The EKG Digitization project was the first step in predicting the results of Cardiac MRIs from EKGs. 
            Cardiac MRIs can be expensive and time consuming. 
            Predicting their results from EKGs will save time and money. The digitized EKGs will be 
            used to train a convolutional neural network to predict a cardiac MRI from an EKG waveform. 
            This project ensured that the pdf forms of the EKGs were digitized into a qualitative form that the 
            CNN could be trained on.

          <h3>Sickbay Data Extraction</h3>
          <p class="info-content">
            <br>
            The Sickbay Data Extraction project focused on extracting waveform data from the Sickbay 
            platform for analysis. The purpose was to provide IBM with this data to train a convolutional 
            neural network to predict Low Cardiac Output Syndrome (LCOS) in children with congenital heart 
            disease (CHD). By developing algorithms to identify common waveforms and determine missing data, 
            I ensured the extraction and delivery of complete datasets to IBM. The overarching goal is to 
            leverage AI to predict LCOS, enabling timely medical interventions and improving patient outcomes.

          <h3>Just A Drop</h3>
          <p class="info-content">
            <br>
            Just A Drop was a project dedicated to raising $4,500 to build a water well in Africa. 
            I successfully fundraised the necessary amount through various means, including speaking at 
            conferences, interviewing for news articles, and organizing raffles at school. After reaching the fundraising goal, 
            I was given the opportunity to choose the well's location in Nigeria. To help as many people as possible, 
            I wrote a Python script that used the haversine equation and longitude and 
            latitude values from the simplemaps.com API to calculate the farthest distance 
            from any existing water well to a city in Nigeria, ensuring the new well would have the maximum impact.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’m a Case Western Reserve University student, balancing a double 
            major in Biochemistry and Computer Science. When I’m not buried in 
            textbooks or coding away, I’m a proud cat mom to my furball, Oatmeal. 
            Pilates and running keep me sane and energized between study sessions. I 
            love traveling, especially hiking vacations, and recently summited Mount Le 
            Conte. With so many activities, I often hunt for new coffee shops to recharge (My go to is a London Fog!). 
            Whether I am climbing mountains, diving into code, or searching for the perfect latte, 
            I’m always driven by curiosity and a thirst for adventure.
